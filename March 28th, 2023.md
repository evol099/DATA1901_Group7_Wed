Notes taken by Brandon
1. Generate graph: (Brandon)
   1. y axis: housing prices for a certain type
      1. One bedroom
      2. Two bedrooms
      3. Three bedrooms
      4. **Three graphs in total, maybe four**
   2. x axis: years sold
   3. A third variable (colour): different suburds
   4. **Aim**: investigate about the price trend for all suburbs across Sydney.
   5. **Implementation**: dots, discrete

2. (Evenly)
   1. Average living wages *from ABS*
   2. Average living costs
   3. $$\frac{\text{living costs (housings)(traffic, food)}}{\text{living wages}}$$
   4. Two factors
      1. living costs
      2. housing prices
