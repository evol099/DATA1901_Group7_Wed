        - THEOREM. Let $A, B, C$ he matrices such that all of the following operations are defined, and let $k \in \mathbb{R}$. Then
            1. $A(BC)=(AB)C$ Thank god that matrix multiplication is  _associative, but it's not commutative._ 
            2. $A(B+C)=AB+AC$
                - Proof. Let $A$ be $m\times n$, $B$, $C$ be $n\times p$. Then $$\begin{aligned}  (A(B+C))_{ij} &= \sum_{k=1}^{n} (A)_{ik} (B+C)_{kj} \\  &= \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{ik} (b_{kj} + c_{kj}) \\  &= \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{ik} b_{kj} + \sum_{k=1}^{n} a_{ik} c_{kj}\\ &= (AB)_{ij} + (AC)_{ij} \end{aligned}$$
                    - Thus concludes the  __proof.__ 
            3. $(A+B)C=AC+BC$ $3,4$ are separate because→it is not  _commutative_ 
            4. $k(AB)=(kA)B=A(kB)$
            5. Associative
                - Notation
                    - If $A$ is a $m\times m$ matrix, we write $A^n = \underbrace{A A A \dots A}_{n}$

            - Q3
                - Solve the recurrence relation: $a_n=\frac{7}{10} a_{n-1}+\frac{4}{10}\left(1-a_{n-1}\right)=\frac{3}{10} a_{n-1}+\frac{4}{10}$ 
                    - Solution: ↓ 
                        - **Unravelling** the recurrence relation, we get:
                        - $$\begin{aligned}
a_n= & \frac{3}{10} a_{n-1}+\frac{4}{10}=\frac{3}{10}\left(\frac{3}{10} a_{n-2}+\frac{4}{10}\right)+\frac{4}{10} \\
= & \left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^2 a_{n-2}+\frac{3}{10} \frac{4}{10}+\frac{4}{10}=\left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^2\left(\frac{3}{10} a_{n-3}+\frac{4}{10}\right)+\frac{3}{10} \frac{4}{10}+\frac{4}{10} \\
= & \left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^3 a_{n-3}+\left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^2 \frac{4}{10}+\frac{3}{10} \frac{4}{10}+\frac{4}{10} \\
& \vdots \\
= & \left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^n a_0+\frac{4}{10}\left[\left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^{n-1}+\cdots+\frac{3}{10}+1\right] \\
= & \left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^n a_0+\frac{4}{10} \frac{\left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^n-1}{\frac{3}{10}-1} \\
= & \left(a_0-\frac{4}{7}\right)\left(\frac{3}{10}\right)^n+\frac{4}{7} .
\end{aligned}$$
                        - Here the second-last equality uses the formula for the sum of a geometric progression.
                    - My:
                        - Do a characteristic equation and obtain $a_n = C(-\frac{1}{2})^n + D(\frac{4}{5})^n$
                        - This is much harder to solve than **unravelling as above** 
            - Q4
                - Let $b_n$ be the number of ways of forming a line of $n$ people distinguished only by whether they are male (M) or female (F), such that no two males are next to each other. For example, the possibilities with 3 people are FFF, FFM, FMF, MFF, and MFM, so $b_3=5$. Write down a recurrence relation for $b_n$. Do you recognize the sequence?
                - **We want to list several instances altogether and trying see ** 
            - Q8 * *
                - For which $n$ is the Fibonacci number $F_n$ even, and for which $n$ is $F_n$ odd? Prove your answer by induction.
            - Q9 * * *
                - Suppose we want to solve a recurrence relation which is almost a $k$ th-order homogeneous linear recurrence relation, but with an extra constant term $C$ :$$a_n=r_1 a_{n-1}+r_2 a_{n-2}+\cdots+r_k a_{n-k}+C \text {, for all } n \geq k .$$Let $p(x)=x^k-r_1 x^{k-1}-\cdots-r_k$ be the characteristic polynomial of the homogeneous recurrence relation obtained by omitting $C$.
                    - (a) Show that any solution $a_n$ also satisfies the $(k+1)$ th-order linear homogeneous recurrence relation with characteristic polynomial $(x-1) p(x)$.
                    - (b) Hence describe the general solution $a_n$ in terms of the roots of $p(x)$. (The answer will depend on whether 1 is a root of $p(x)$ or not.)
        - Tutorial 05
            - Q1 (C)
                - $a_n=5 a_{n-1}-6 a_{n-2}+4^n+2 n+3$ for $n \geq 2$ where $a_0=5, a_1=19$ 
                - Solution: 
                    - The characteristic polynomial is $(x-2)(x-3)$, so the solution of the homogeneous recurrence relation is $c_n=C_1 2^n+C_2 3^n$. For a particular solution try $p_n=A n+B+C 4^n$; we must have
                    - $p_n=An+B+C4^n$ 
                    - $$\begin{aligned}
A n+B+C 4^n= & 5\left(A(n-1)+B+C 4^{n-1}\right) \\
& \quad-6\left(A(n-2)+B+C 4^{n-2}\right)+4^n+2 n+3 \\
= & -A n+7 A-B+14 C 4^{n-2}+4^n+2 n+3
\end{aligned}$$
                    - yielding
                    - $$2 A n-7 A+2 B+2 C 4^{n-2}=2 n+3+16 \times 4^{n-2} .$$
                    - Equating coefficients yields $A=1, B=5, C=8$, so that $p_n=n+5+2 \times 4^{n+1}$ is our desired particular solution. The general solution is
                    - $$a_n=C_1 2^n+C_2 3^n+n+5+2 \times 4^{n+1} .$$
                    - In our case the constants must be such that $5=a_0=C_1+C_2+13$ and $19=a_1=2 C_1+3 C_2+38$. Solving simultaneously yields $C_1=-5, C_2=-3$, producing the final solution
                    - $$a_n=n+5-5 \times 2^n-3^{n+1}+2 \times 4^{n+1} \text {. }$$
                - Reflection
                    - The general principle is that when trying a $p_n$, look at the numbers, for example, $4$, that has close relationship with the variable $n$.
                    - Our coefficients are limited to numbers unrelated to these only.
